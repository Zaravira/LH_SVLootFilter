# Description
This mod adds a filter for mining materials and also applies this filter to the refinery. 
Gone are the days where your inventory fills up with stuff you don't want and constantly need to destroy while you're out mining.
It works with the existing lootfilter and sticks a button in the lootfilter config to access it, so you can pick and choose what you want.

It does not alter the refinery output, it destroys the refinery output you don't want.

# Limitations
It does not save settings outside of the game, so every time you restart Star Valor it will be back on default and pick up everything as usual. 
It also cannot be set differently for individual ships, it is global.

# Installing
Grab both the LH_SVLootFilter.dll and lh_svlootfilter from the release and stick them both into steam\steamapps\common\Star Valor\BepInEx\plugins folder.
You'll have to install BepInEx first if you haven't already though.
